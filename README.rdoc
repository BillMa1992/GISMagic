As a GIS master and web-mapping lover, I created this website for my interest

Project 1: Pinteresting. I learned Ruby on Rails and create this function that can let users login and share their pictures.<br />
Project 2: Site Tweets Streaming. This is a javaScript API for tweets streaming usage of a single user.<br />
Project 3: Tweets Weather Map. I combined some python code with flask to use tweepy help me create a map showing real-time twitter messages about weather. Besides, there's a weather report.<br />
